# Module 18 Challenge

## Key Learnings

1. **Model Architecture Design**:
   - Understanding how to design a neural network architecture with multiple hidden layers.
   - Using different activation functions like `ReLU` for hidden layers and `softmax` or `sigmoid` for output layers based on the classification task.

2. **Handling Multi-Output Models**:
   - Creating models with multiple outputs, each tailored for different classification tasks (e.g., multi-class and binary classification).
   - Compiling the model with appropriate loss functions for each output.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Scaling input features to improve model performance.
   - Encoding categorical variables for use in neural networks.

4. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - Implementing dropout layers to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping units during training.
   - Using batch normalization to stabilize and accelerate training.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Training the model with training data and evaluating its performance on test data.
   - Using callbacks like early stopping and learning rate reduction to improve training efficiency and prevent overfitting.

6. **Interpreting Model Outputs**:
   - Understanding how to interpret the output probabilities from `softmax` and `sigmoid` activation functions.
   - Unpacking and analyzing the evaluation results to assess model performance.

7. **Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Adjusting the learning rate and using learning rate scheduling to help the model converge more effectively.
   - Experimenting with different batch sizes and epochs to find the optimal training configuration.
